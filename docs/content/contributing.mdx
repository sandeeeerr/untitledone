# Contributing

We welcome contributions to UntitledOne! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Follow the [Installation Guide](/installation) to set up the development environment
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix

## Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: For code linting
- **Prettier**: For code formatting
- **TypeScript**: For type safety

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Formatting
npm run format

# Run all checks
npm run check
```

## Project Structure

UntitledOne follows these architectural principles:

### Server-First Development
- Data fetching via React Server Components and Server Actions
- Minimize client-side components
- Use Suspense boundaries for loading states

### Atomic Design
- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
- **Molecules**: Simple component combinations
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections
- **Templates**: Page layouts

### Database Guidelines

#### Migrations
- All migrations must be idempotent
- Use `if not exists` / `if exists` clauses
- Include rollback instructions as comments

#### RLS Policies
- Always specify policies per operation (select/insert/update/delete)
- Use `(select auth.uid())` for user filtering
- Explicit `to authenticated/anon` clauses

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

### Component Testing
```bash
npm run storybook
```
