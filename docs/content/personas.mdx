# Personas & How Might We

This page outlines a few lightweight personas and HMW questions to keep design and development aligned. Replace or extend as needed.

## Personas

### Indie Producer (Lena)
- Goals: Share works-in-progress quickly, collect timestamped feedback, keep versions organized
- Pain points: Scattered feedback across apps, file chaos, unclear version context
- Success: Faster iteration cycles with clear decision history

### Collaborating Duo (Ava & Max)
- Goals: Exchange stems, review takes, resolve comments efficiently
- Pain points: Lost context in chats, version naming confusion, permissions headaches
- Success: One place for files, comments, and decisions

### Mentor / Coach (Kai)
- Goals: Give precise, constructive feedback at timestamps, track progress
- Pain points: Noisy channels, unclear follow-ups, missing history
- Success: Targeted notes, resolved threads, visible improvement over time

## How Might We

- How might we make timestamped feedback so effortless that it becomes the default?
- How might we keep version context clear without heavy project management?
- How might we ensure creators retain ownership and control over visibility?
- How might we make collaboration feel like "being in the studio together" remotely?
