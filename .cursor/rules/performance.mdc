# Performance & React Server Components

## Best Practices
- Minimize `use client` directives - prefer Server Components where possible
- Use `React.lazy()` and dynamic imports for non-critical UI components
- Optimize images and implement appropriate Suspense fallbacks
- Leverage `useMemo` for expensive computations instead of inline calculations

## Avoid
- Unnecessary client-side components when Server Components would suffice
- Heavy computations in render functions
- Loading large dependencies without code splitting
