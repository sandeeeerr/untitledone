# i18n â€“ next-intl

## Best Practices

### Do
- Use `useTranslations()` hook for all UI strings - avoid hardcoded text
- Structure translation keys as `scope.section.key` - avoid using full sentences as keys
- Handle pluralization through `t.rich` or plural rules
- Keep translations organized and maintainable

### Avoid
- Letting untranslated text from server responses bubble up to the UI
- Mixing translation approaches within components
- Duplicating translation keys
