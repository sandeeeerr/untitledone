# Email (Resend)

## Best Practices

- Keep email functionality server-side only; never expose API keys in client bundles
- Store email templates in `src/components/templates/email-*.tsx`
- Maintain consistent DKIM configuration and `from` domain across all emails

## Avoid

- Sending emails from client-side components
- Exposing email configuration or credentials in client code
