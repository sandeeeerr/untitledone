# Forms & Validation

## Best Practices
- Use `react-hook-form` with `@hookform/resolvers/zod` for form management and validation
- Validate at the edges: Use Zod schemas in Server Actions/API endpoints
- Display field errors inline using aria-* attributes and `FormMessage` components
- Keep form state management consistent within a form

## Avoid
- Mixing controlled and uncontrolled form components in the same form
- Client-side validation without corresponding server-side validation
